is the solid form of water . Ice has a rigid lattice structure , in a tetrahedral crystalline form which resembles giant molecular elements . Its appears in various forms , such as in hard amalgamated crystals like ice cubes , or loosely accumulated granules like in snow . Unlike liquid water , hydrogen bonding plays a stronger role in the density and shape of ice than the covalent bonds as the water molecules are pressed against each other very closely . This causes the repelling nature of like-like charges to overcome the forces of attraction in the structure , causing ice to exhibit the unusual characteristic of becoming less dense as it cools , where conventional wisdom declares that the lower the temperature the denser a matter becomes . The density of ice is 0.931 g/cubic cm	769	0.24977475	-0.022789774	-0.028893413	13.156835	-7.548635	-0.7147451	-0.5922359	0.104784325	-0.4030738	8	7	8	13

is called low - density lipoprotein . It is the complete opposite of good cholesterol in its composition . This means that there are more lipids found in each low - density lipoprotein molecule , as compared to high - density lipoproteins . These molecules are responsible for carrying lipoproteins from the liver to the blood stream . In turn , it causes these cholesterol molecules to accumulate in the veins and the arteries , causing a thickening of the vein and artery walls . Eventually , the cholesterol will also end up making its way to the blood vessels around the heart . This thickening of the walls of the blood vessels will not only restrict blood flow , but also cause the heart to work harder than usual	389	0.24777769	-0.022930285	-0.027887369	12.392132	-7.7577996	-1.7588837	-0.59243023	0.104523525	-0.40245047	8	7	8	13

, in its natural state , exists as a liquid . The hydrogen atoms inside the water molecules are not sufficiently close ; hence the hydrogen bonding between the molecules is constantly forming and breaking . This causes water to lack a distinct structure , and gives it its fluid appearance . In its liquid state , a water molecule is on average only hydrogen-bonded to approximately 3.4 neighbouring water molecules at any one time . The density of liquid water is 1.00 g/cubic cm	1818	0.24713963	-0.023088798	-0.028529147	12.562374	-7.592441	-0.96246	-0.5924049	0.10637882	-0.40354696	8	7	8	13
